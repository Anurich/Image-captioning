<h2>Image captioning</h2>
Image Captioning is the process of generating textual description of an image.
It uses both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to generate the captions.
So in this work I try to implement neural network that are capable of generating text given an image.

<h2> Network Architecture </h2>
In this work i use two different network one for extract the image from image and second is LSTM network for generating the text using that image.
